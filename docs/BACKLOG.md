# J.A.R.V.I.S. — the work

The decided work, the single list: the backlog, the review's open
recommendations, and the plan of the next sessions. Both machines see it
through git. The developer reads it; the architect manages it and, while a
developer session runs, does not edit it (`CLAUDE.md`, "Parallel sessions").
What is not work yet — what waits for the user, open discussions — is
`PENDING.md`; how the work is done is `PROCESS.md`. Split out of
`CONTEXT.md` on 12/10/2026; CONTEXT's sections 8, 13.4 and 14.4 point here.

---

## 1. Backlog

**The project's single list.** Both machines see it through git. Each item
says where it came from:

- **(decided)** — the user asked for it or approved it
- **(proposto)** — Claude's suggestion, no decision from the user yet

Proposed items **are not a plan**. Never start one without asking. The
architecture review's recommendations are separate (section 2) and the
**high**-priority ones come before items here. The full text of every
finished item is in `HISTORY.md` 8.

### Done

| | Item | Where |
|---|---|---|
| ✓ | Tiered storage (decided) — to an external drive after 30 days | ARCHITECTURE 11 |
| ✓ | Phone notifications through Telegram, with a face and a name (decided) | ARCHITECTURE 12 |
| ✓ | Core without a window (decided) | ARCHITECTURE 15 |
| ✓ | **3.** The web interface, the only way in (decided 09/10) | ARCHITECTURE 17 |
| ✓ | **5.** Play recordings on the page (decided 11/10, `v2026.10.11.3`) | ARCHITECTURE 17.13 |
| ✓ | **9.** Undo a merge — closed by the user: a warning before every merge instead | — |
| ✓ | **15.** Animal re-ID — superseded by 22 | HISTORY 8 |
| ✓ | **17.** Production and test environments (decided 09/10) | ARCHITECTURE 18.7 |
| ✓ | **18.** The running version on the page (decided 10/10) | ARCHITECTURE 12.10 |
| ✓ | **19.** People by person; attach a face to a name; the waiting queue; rename (decided 10/10, `v2026.10.10.4`) | ARCHITECTURE 17.10 |
| ✓ | **20.** Who appears in each recording (decided 10/10) | ARCHITECTURE 17.10 |
| ✓ | **21.** A favourite photo per person (decided 10/10, `v2026.10.10.6`) | ARCHITECTURE 17.10 |
| ✓ | **22.** A Dogs tab: each household teaches its own dogs (decided 10/10, `v2026.10.10.7`); thresholds wait for ~10 named views per dog per lighting | ARCHITECTURE 20 |
| ✓ | **23.** Report a bad detection instead of deleting it, with Undo (decided 11/10, `v2026.10.11.4`) | ARCHITECTURE 21 |
| ✓ | **24.** "Choose the best 40" views; Chosen and Waiting (decided 11/10, `v2026.10.11.4`) | ARCHITECTURE 17.14 |
| ✓ | **25.** Residents, notification cases and the Home/Away/Silent modes, the Notifications tab, commands from the phone (decided 12/10, `v2026.10.12`) | ARCHITECTURE 22 |
| ✓ | **26.** Select many unnamed photos, name or report them at once (decided 12/10, `v2026.10.12.2`) | ARCHITECTURE 17.16 |
| ✓ | **27.** Notifications as the first part of Settings (decided 12/10, `v2026.10.12.2`) | ARCHITECTURE 22.4 |
| ✓ | **29.** `/on` and `/off` from the bot; Off never stored (decided 13/10, `v2026.10.13`) | ARCHITECTURE 22.7 |
| ✓ | **30.** Home silences a probable resident: two cases of their own (decided 13/10, `v2026.10.13`) | ARCHITECTURE 22.2 |
| ✓ | **31.** Detection sensitivity per label in Settings (decided 13/10, `45aa0e5`, review 21, `v2026.10.14`) | ARCHITECTURE 7.14 |
| ✓ | **28.** The 40 views manage themselves (decided 13/10, `6345a7d`, `47a2e6a`, review 20; released with R49 in `v2026.10.14`, review 23). The once-only `settle_waiting.py` waits for the misfiled dog views to be deleted; the faces' side is ready since 14/10 (`PENDING.md`) | ARCHITECTURE 17.14 |
| ✓ | **34.** Analysis On and Off from the page header; Off asks first, On is one click (decided 14/10, `8828e5c`, review 24, `v2026.10.14.2`) | ARCHITECTURE 22.7 |
| ✓ | **35.** Detection sensitivity as sliders, the default in the middle, the explanation beside them (decided 14/10, `87a84fd`, review 24, `v2026.10.14.2`) | ARCHITECTURE 7.14 |
| ✓ | **36.** Notifications: the Telegram card beside "What reaches the phone" (decided 14/10, `6295d57`, review 24, `v2026.10.14.2`) | ARCHITECTURE 22.4 |
| ✓ | **37 (a, b).** People and Dogs on a phone: two columns, long lists 24 at a time, Waiting newest first (decided, UX, `b8a731b`, review 25, `v2026.10.14.3`); the self-cleaning part waits for the user (`PENDING.md`) | ARCHITECTURE 17.17 |
| ✓ | **38.** The default marked on each slider (decided, UX, `03cde0e`, review 25, `v2026.10.14.3`) | ARCHITECTURE 7.14 |
| ✓ | **32.** The sure threshold chosen from measured accuracy: faces (decided 13/10, `9fc5592`, review 25, `v2026.10.14.3`), dogs' sure distance (`bc94747`, review 27, `v2026.10.15.2`), both measured by leave-one-event-out (R55) | ARCHITECTURE 10.15, 20 |
| ✓ | **39.** On a phone, an unnamed card is its photo and its name; the empty accuracy table hidden (decided, UX, `a9b8c32`, review 26, `v2026.10.15`) | ARCHITECTURE 17.17 |

**Waiting for the user's check on the M900:** items 25, 3, 29, 30, 34–39 and 32, in `PENDING.md`.

### Decided on 13/10/2026, to build

Items 28–32 are done (above); their full text is in `HISTORY.md` 8.

### Decided on 14/10/2026, to build

Items 34–39 are done (above, reviews 24 to 26); their full text is in
`HISTORY.md` 8.

### Critical

Without these the system does not do its job well.

1. **Zones of interest per camera** (proposto) — today there is only a fixed
   mask over the camera's clock, in the code. Every competitor has drawable
   zones, and it is the biggest control over false positives there is.
   Mosquitoes, wall objects and sunlight have already cost time; a zone saying
   "only the garage matters" would have avoided almost all of it. Worth
   separating a **mask** (ignore the area) from a **required zone** (detect
   everything, but notify only when something enters it).
2. **System health** (proposto) — if a camera dies at 3 a.m., nothing warns.
   There is an automatic restart, but no record of how long it was down.
   **A real case, 14/10 16:32–16:39:** both cameras left the network and the
   log holds no line about it (HISTORY 13.26). A
   daily summary, or a "camera down" case among backlog 25's switches, would
   close it.

### Important

It works without them, but is incomplete.

4. **Measure the M900 running** (proposto) — CPU with both cameras in motion,
   and whether `HWACCEL` helps (INSTALL 6).
6. **Search and filter** (proposto) — with ~100 events a day, by date only is
   not enough. By person, camera, label.
7. **Tracking** (proposto) — keep identity across frames; it solves the person
   standing still and makes one clip match one person.
8. **Animal labels** (proposto) — accept a species only when it repeats within
   the event, instead of accumulating every YOLO hesitation.
10. **Audio** (proposto) — the cameras send PCM and `-an` drops it. Barking,
    shouting, breaking glass.

### Improvement

11. **A timeline** (proposto) — a grid of cards does not answer "what happened
    between 2 and 4 a.m.".
12. **Persist the static spots** (proposto) — the list starts empty on every
    run, so the night's first false clip is still recorded.
13. **An event database** (proposto) — SQLite instead of JSON files, once
    there is search.
14. **OpenVINO on the M900** (proposto) — `cv2.dnn` accepts that backend; it
    was the plan to win back the speed lost when leaving PyTorch.

33. **Report a bad detection from the phone** (proposto, 13/10/2026) — a
    "Not a dog" / "Not a person" button under each Telegram message, as
    commercial systems put actions in their notifications; one tap files the
    same report as the page (ARCHITECTURE 21), where the user sees the
    mistake first.

### Outside software

16. **A motion-triggered light at the Front** (proposto) — not code, but the
    biggest possible gain for faces at night (ARCHITECTURE 10.5).

### What competitors have that this does not (13/10/2026)

The user asked. Compared with Frigate, Blue Iris, UniFi Protect, Ring and
Nest, from the architect's knowledge up to mid-2026:

| Gap | Here |
|---|---|
| Zones per camera: ignore an area, or alert only when something enters it | 1 |
| Tracking: the label comes from the object's history, not one frame | 7; R44 and R46 cover the bend |
| Per-object filters: minimum score, size, ratio, the median score over the track | 31 |
| A warning when a camera goes down | 2 |
| A timeline and a review of alerts | 11 |
| Search by person or object; natural-language search; event descriptions by AI | 6 |
| Audio detection: barking, breaking glass, shouting | 10 |
| Actions inside the notification | 33 |
| Continuous 24/7 recording | — (this records by event) |
| Hardware acceleration | 14 |

### Deliberately out of scope

Competitors have these and they make **no** sense here: multiple users with
permissions, cloud or subscription, support for dozens of camera brands, PTZ,
two-way audio, number-plate reading, Home Assistant integration. They are
product features; this system is for one house with two cameras. If someone
proposes one, the answer is already here.

## 2. Recommendations, open

The closed ones, with their commits and texts: `HISTORY.md` 13.4. **R50 is
not used**, so that it is never read as the name of ArcFace R50, the face
model; R48 and R49 closed in review 23, R30, R51 and R52 in review 24, R42
in review 25, R53, R56 and R57 in review 26, R55 in review 27.

| # | Priority | Recommendation | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| R54 | medium — a watch | Best of N and the looser frontal gate give a stranger more chances to read "probably <resident>", silent in Home | open (below) |
| R47 | low — a watch | R46's chain has no end: a real dog that takes a vanished person's place would stay a person | open (below) |
| R12 | medium | Production and test copy on the same M900 double the CPU load | open (HISTORY 13.5) |
| R14 | low | Live MJPEG is encoded once per viewer | open (HISTORY 13.5) |
| R9 | verification | `python-preference = "system"` on the development PC | open (HISTORY 13.4) |

**R54 — Best of N and a looser gate give a stranger more chances to pass
as a resident (medium, a watch, review 24).** R51 matches every view of a
face group and keeps the best, with `Gallery.match`'s preference — a named
person first, then the score; R30 (b) lets more looking-down faces in. Both
are measured only on the two residents (ARCHITECTURE 10.3, 10.12): the other
resident's best rose by 0.013, never reaching 0.30. What nobody measured is a
stranger: N views are N chances to cross `MATCH_THRESHOLD` against a
resident, and a returning stranger whose views match their own unnamed entry
at 0.6 is recorded "probably <resident>" by one view at 0.30 — silent in
Home, against the user's rule that an unknown person always reaches the
phone (CONTEXT 3). Production holds no stranger with a face yet (2 named
entries, 0 unnamed, 14/10). **Trigger:** a "probably Gustavo" or "probably
Izabel" sighting whose photo is someone else, reported by the user or seen in
a review. **Then:** measure, on that clip, the two cross-view rules that keep
R51's gain for residents — the score alone deciding across views (a named
match only wins within one view, as `Gallery.match` does), or a resident
needing two views over the threshold — and keep the one that names the
stranger right without losing a resident's sure sighting of R51's table.

**R47 — R46's chain has no end (low, a watch, 13/10/2026).** Every
relabelled box renews both memories (ARCHITECTURE 7.13), so a real dog that
takes the place of a person who vanished — someone stepping out of view right
over a dog — stays a person while YOLO keeps seeing it within 0.3 of its last
box: the event says person, no dog crop is kept, and in Home a faceless-person
message goes out. None of the true-dog boxes in twelve clips did, and a cap
would cut the long bends R46 exists for. **Trigger:** a "not a person" report
whose `replay.py` trace shows "took the place of a person who vanished".
**Then:** bound the chain — for instance, a relabelled box renews the memory
only within some seconds of the last real person box, measured on R46's
bends (HISTORY 13.20). Since backlog 31, a person minimum set below 0.35
feeds the memories more boxes and lengthens the chain (ARCHITECTURE 7.14).

## 3. Next sessions

**Review 27 is done:** developer 25's R55 and backlog 32 for dogs, tagged
`v2026.10.15.2` (HISTORY 13.28). R55 is closed and backlog 32 is done for
both halves; nothing was opened.

**No developer session is planned.** Nothing decided waits: every open
backlog item is **(proposto)** and every open recommendation is a watch or
not planned. The next session starts from the user's choice among the
proposed items (`PENDING.md`, open discussions).

**Waits for the user:** choosing the sure threshold for faces and the sure
distance for dogs from the two tables in Settings → Detection (the defaults
hold until then); the policy for unnamed faces (backlog 37, `PENDING.md`);
the misfiled dog views, thirteen, before the once-only settle of backlog
28 — the new model sees them right, but four sit in Chosen, where every
match is measured against them; the M900 sleeping at the sign-in screen;
the checks on the M900 (`PENDING.md`).

**Not planned:** R54 and R47 are watches. R14, R12 and R9 as before. Every
other open backlog item is **(proposto)**.
